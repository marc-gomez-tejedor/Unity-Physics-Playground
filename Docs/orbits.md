# Orbits Demo
**Concept:** Quick physics demo that simulates a simple Star system with a center Star, 3 planets orbiting and the main Rocket.
The idea is to simulate gravity fields from the Star and the different planets based on its masses and distances and how that affects the rocket.

**Physics:** Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

**GIF concept:** To show how objects are affected by the gravitational fields, modify some parameters from the editor and show how that affects to the system to see how it affects in real time
