# Orbits Development Process
I'm setting up the scene for the star, the planets, etc and the main goal is to make it as much physically realistic as possible, but that idea has a few drawbacks:

## First Challenge: 
- Issue: Distances, Sizes and Masses of bodies.
If I were to set sizes and distances between planets like the ones in our Solar System it would give me quite some trouble, since the the distance between the Sun and the Earth is: 149.600.000km (too much for unity of course)
But I can't just scale down distances and bodies sizes and masses since the Gravitational Law is not linear, so it wouldn't work as intended. 

- First Solution: Estimate through the Gravitational Law's formula how the real Solar System behaves (
