# Orbits Development Process
## First Challenge: 
I'm setting up the scene for the star, the planets, etc and the main goal is to make it as much physically realistic as possible, but that idea has a few drawbacks:
	- Distances: If I were to set sizes and distances between planets like the ones in our Solar System it would give me quite some trouble, since the the distance between the Sun and the Earth is: 149.600.000km (too much for unity of course)
